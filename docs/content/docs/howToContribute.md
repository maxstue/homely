### SmartHub

Follow these steps if you want to contribute to the __SmartHub__ project

#### Installation

1. Docker
    - Download and install docker for your OS [Link](https://docs.docker.com/)
2. .Net 5
    - Download and install .net 5 sdk for your OS [Link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
3. Node.js
    - Download and install Node.js for you OS [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. Ef core tool
    - Install Entity Framework core tool globally. Insert following command into your terminal:
    `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`  
    - To update it type into a terminal `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef`
5. Clone Repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/SmartHub-Io/SmartHub.git`
6. Build and create database
    - Go to "SmartHub.Api/"
        - Type into a terminal `dotnet restore` then `dotnet build`
    - Go to "SmartHub.Ui/"
        - Type into a terminal `npm install`
    - Go to "SmartHub.Api/"
        - Type into a terminal `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` (so you don't need to open a new terminal)
        - Open the "appsetting.json" file and pass in your __Pgsql_User__ and __Pgsql_pwd__.(see below for default values)
            - **OR** `dotnet ef database update -- Pgsql_User=<your name> Pgsql_pwd=<your pwd>` (if yo do this you can skip the next step)
        - Type into terminal `dotnet ef database update` **This is not absolutely necessary, because it is executed automatically at startup.**

#### Run

1. Run `docker-compose up` from the "SmartHub.Api/" folder. _(starting database)_
2. Run `dotnet run Use_Staticfiles_DEV=false Pgsql_User=<your name> Pgsql_pwd=<your pwd>` from "SmartHub.Api" folder.
    - Or in your IDE run the "SmartHub.Api--Args" project Task from "launchSetting.json". _(starting backend)_
3. If _Use_Staticfiles_DEV=true_ you don't need to run `npm run serve` from the "SmartHub.Ui/" folder, because the Ui is being served from the backend. _(starting frontend)_
4. Open your browser and go to "localhost:8080" (UI) or "localhost:5000/swagger"(swagger).

__Pgsql_User__ => the username which is set in the docker-compose.override.yml file (__default__ == postgres)  
__Pgsql_pwd__ => the pwd which is set in the docker-compose.override.yml file (__default__ == 1234)  
    -> Edit these in the docker.compose.override.yml file  
__Use_Staticfiles_DEV__ => indicates whether the program uses a proxy to the separated started Ui or servers the Ui as static files (default is "false")
> Be aware running the program without these args will cause errors at the moment !!!
