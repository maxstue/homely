# Introduction

[SmartHub](https://github.com/SmartHub-Io/SmartHub) is a project for anyone who want to upgrade his home with some small digital helpers to improve his life.

__This documantion and the project are still a WIP and we appreciate any help we can get :)__

## Fast by default

This project is fast from the beginning and only has necessary stuff in it.
If you want more than the core offer you can extend it with plugins.

## Easy for everyone

We aim to write a software that is easy to understand and yet powerful to do all the things a user want it to do.
For the user we try to make it as intuitive and easy to use as possible.
