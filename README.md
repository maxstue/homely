<h1 align="center">Welcome to homely 👋</h1>

> This is a smarthome project based on asp.net (core)5, ef (core) 5, postgreSql and with Vue3 and typescript and tailwindcss.  
> This project and the docs are still __work in progress__.

Visit the official [documentation](https://smarthub-io.github.io/SmartHub-Docs/) for more information.

The Idea behind homely is to make smarthome software on raspberry pis etc. more accessible to the average person, by making the the installation and the Ui as easy to use.
But also having advacned features and settings for more advanced users.

The biggest goal for me is that I can completely use __homely__ at home and make it an open source project where everyone (especially beginners) can try out/ learn new things and contribute it.

> Currently it only works with [the Shelly Rest Api](https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/) for turning Lights on/off and retrieving their status.  
> A more generic plugin system is under development. If you have any idea on how to improve it, please feel free to open an issue or a new discussion. 😃
